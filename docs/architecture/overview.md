# Architecture Overview

## 1. Purpose

This repository is a **reference implementation of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** using **RabbitMQ** and **.NET**.
The goal is to demonstrate **production-grade messaging patterns** (idempotency, retries, DLQ, ACK/NACK, observability) with **clean boundaries** (Clean Architecture + DDD-friendly design).

This is **not** a generic SDK. It is an **architecture playbook** with runnable examples.
